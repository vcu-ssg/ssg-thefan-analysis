This report explores an export data file for the Fan District Association looking
for data inconsistencies and overall metrics.

## Initial data exploration

```{python}
#| echo: false
from reports.utils import ExcelAnalyzer

export_file_name = "../data/2025-02-17 Contacts Fan District Association.xls"
metrics = ExcelAnalyzer( export_file_name )

```

## Overall summary of records

```{python}
metrics.summary()
```

## User IDs by level

Only records marked with *Membership enabled = yes* are included in the list.

```{python}
metrics.count_membership_by_level()
```

## Bundles by level

A *bundle* is a group of *user ids* that share a single membership. 

```{python}
metrics.count_bundles_by_level()
```

## Duplicate Emails

Below is a list of user ID with duplicate emails.  This list
is most probably clean.

```{python}
metrics.get_users_with_duplicate_emails()
```


## Duplicate names

Below is a list of members with the same first and last names.  Note the *Membership enabled" column.  If *Membership enabled* is *yes* for both records, then this 
record is a duplicate.
```{python}
metrics.get_users_with_duplicate_names()
```
