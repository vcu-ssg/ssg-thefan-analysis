The Fan District Association's annual Holiday House Tour in Richmond, Virginia, is a cherished tradition that invites visitors to explore the neighborhood's historic homes adorned in festive holiday decor. Held each December, the self-guided walking tour showcases a variety of architectural styles, including Queen Anne, Italianate, Tudor Revival, and Colonial Revival, reflecting the area's development between 1890 and 1930.

The 2024 tour featured eight properties, seven of which were open to the public for the first time, offering a unique glimpse into the district's rich architectural tapestry . Attendees could stroll through the neighborhood or utilize complimentary tuk-tuk rides provided along the route.â€‹

Proceeds from the event support the Fan District Association's initiatives, including neighborhood preservation, restoration projects, and community enhancements. This festive tour not only celebrates the holiday season but also fosters community spirit and appreciation for Richmond's historic charm.

The Fan District Association [maintains a workbook](./data/1963-2024 HHT Homeowners_Adresses_modified.xlsx) documenting previous holiday house tours.

This document represents an analysis of the workbook and it's associated [cleaned data file](./data/hht_addresses_with_geo.csv).
